##  Introduction
The purpose of this exercise is for the developer to exhibit his familiarity with frontend technologies, 
programming patterns and to provide with a sample of what clean and reusable code means to the candidate.
Please put your comment about the decisions you have made inline, and give a summary about the architectural choices that you considered.

## Exercise
We will use http://ergast.com/mrd/ to create a single page application that presents 
- A list that shows F1 world champions from 2005 until 2015.
- Clicking on an item shows the list of the winners for every race for the selected year.
- We also request to highlight the row when the winner has been the world champion in the same season.
